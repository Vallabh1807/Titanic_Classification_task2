# Titanic_Classification_task2

Summary The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and other relevant factors. Steps Involved:

1) Data Exploration and Visualization: Understand the dataset structure and data types. Handle missing values (e.g., missing ages, embarked locations). Visualize data distributions and relationships using plots (e.g., histograms, bar plots, correlation heatmaps).
2) Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values by imputing or removing them. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques such as one-hot encoding. Feature engineering to create new relevant features or modify existing ones. Normalize or standardize numerical features if needed.
3) Model Selection: Split the data into training and testing sets. Select a range of machine learning algorithms to evaluate Perform cross-validation to assess the performance of different models.
4) Model Training and Evaluation: Train selected models on the training dataset. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance using techniques like grid search or random search.
5) Model Interpretation: Analyze feature importance to understand which features are most influential in predicting survival.
6) Model Deployment: Once the best-performing model is selected, prepare it for deployment. Develop a user interface or API for the model if necessary, allowing users to input passenger data and receive survival predictions.
